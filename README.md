## HI! These are my .files.

I like minimalistic GUIs and i absolutely hate bloatware as such i keep programs i use to a minimum.

### Theme
The theme i use is [Bright Bit](https://github.com/Azeved00/bright-bit)

### Aplications:
- Window Manager -> [I3](https://github.com/i3/i3)
- Browser -> [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- Terminal -> [Alacrity](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- Text Editor -> [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- Managing Configuration Files -> [Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
- File Browser -> [LF](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)

Feel free to take what you want and use them as you need. 

### Have fun!

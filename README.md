## HI!
These are my .files
Feel free to take what you want 
Have fun!

## Things to Remember!
1. Installation is done trough `install.sh` @ the repo root
2. When opening neovim for the first time dont forget to use :PlugInstall to update plugins 

### if you don't use NixOs:
- install SpaceMono Nerd font (bold or regular) to have all icons

## Things that are missing!

- [ ] Add some screenshots (maybe)
- [ ] Cheat Sheet for controls would be nice (in python would be fun)
- [ ] Transitioning to home manager

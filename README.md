## HI!
This is my .files repository
Feel free to take what you want 
Have fun!


## Things to Remember!


1. Installation is done trough install.sh @ the repo root </li>
2. When opening neovim for the first time dont forget to use :PlugInstall to update plugins</li>



## Things that are missing!

- Configuration files are not automatically put in the .config folder
- Add "asking" to install.sh to separate OSs and use casses and etc..
- add a more apps since the ones here are very basic

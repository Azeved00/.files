## HI!
These are my .files
Feel free to take what you want 
Have fun!


## Things to Remember!
1. Installation is done trough `install.sh` @ the repo root
2. When opening neovim for the first time dont forget to use :PlugInstall to update plugins
3. install SpaceMono Nerd font (bold or regular) to have all icons 


## Things that are missing!

- [ ] Configuration files are not automatically put in the .config folder
- [ ] Add "asking" to install.sh to separate OSs and use casses and etc..
- [ ] Add a more apps since the ones here are very basic
- [ ] SSH key generation
- [ ] Automatically get win32yank tool when wsl
- [ ] Make install script download the repo so that we ca use `curl` to get it and it handles everything for us

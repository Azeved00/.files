## HI!
This is my .files repository
Feel free to take what you want 
Have fun!


## Things to Remember!


1. Installation is done trough install.sh @ the repo root </li>
2. When opening neovim for the first time dont forget to use :PlugInstall to update plugins</li>
3. install SpaceMono Nerd font (bold or regular) to have all icons 

## Things that are missing!

- Configuration files are not automatically put in the .config folder
- Add "asking" to install.sh to separate OSs and use casses and etc..
- add a more apps since the ones here are very basic
- SSH key generation is still missing
- currently nvim config to be used in WSL, create 2 different config files one for WSL and the other for linux installations
- automatically get win32yank tool when wsl
